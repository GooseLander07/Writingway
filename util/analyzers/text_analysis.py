    "complex": """
        <b>Complex sentences</b><br>
        Highlights sentences that are very long or have many clauses, making them hard to follow.<br>
        Consider breaking them into shorter, clearer sentences.
    """,
    "weak": """
        <b>Weak formulations/passive voice</b><br>
        Marks parts of the text where the language is not assertive.<br>
        Includes:<br>
        - Weak formulations (phrases that sound vague or indecisive)<br>
        - Passive voice (sentences where the subject isn't performing the action)<br>
        Example: 'The ball was thrown' vs 'John threw the ball'<br>
        Both can make writing feel less direct and lively.
    """,
    "nonstandard": """
        <b>Non-standard speech verbs</b><br>
        Identifies unusual or uncommon verbs used for speaking<br>
        (instead of common words like 'said').<br>
        These can confuse readers if they're too creative or unfamiliar.
    """,
    "filter": """
        <b>Filter words</b><br>
        Flags words that act as filters â€“ words that soften or obscure the message<br>
        (like 'just,' 'really,' or 'quite').<br>
        Removing them can make your statements stronger and clearer.
    """,
    "telling": """
        <b>Telling not showing</b><br>
        Highlights parts where the text tells what a character feels or does<br>
        instead of showing it through description or action.<br>
        This can make the narrative less engaging.
    """,
    "weak_verb": """
        <b>Weak verbs</b><br>
        Marks verbs that don't convey a strong sense of action or emotion.<br>
        Replacing them with vivid, precise verbs can make writing more dynamic.
    """,
    "overused": """
        <b>Overused words</b><br>
        Identifies words that appear too often, making the text repetitive or dull.<br>
        Consider using synonyms or rephrasing to keep language fresh.
    """,
    "pronoun": """
        <b>Unclear pronoun references</b><br>
        Flags pronouns ('he,' 'she,' 'it,' 'they') with unclear noun references.<br>
        Clear pronoun use is important to avoid confusion.
    """,
    "repetitive": """
        <b>Repetitive sentence starts</b><br>
        Highlights when several sentences begin the same way.<br>
        Varying sentence beginnings helps keep the reader's interest.
